# Witch-Observation-Diary-Partial-function-try  
"Serving as a teaching assistant for the game **Witch Observation Diary**, working out some methods to meet their project requirements"  
****
These two project folders in the folder **WODtry** are served for the realization of partial functions in **Witch Observation Diary**, which was one of the games developed during the third training held by Jiao Tong University, where I was responsible for the teaching assistant of this group.  
****
The one called **URPTest2019** is used to meet the **2D Bloom** requirement with the help of **URP** and **Shadergraph**, and it's my first time to get in touch with these technologies, so it is not unexpected if there're some unreasonable codes or structures.
