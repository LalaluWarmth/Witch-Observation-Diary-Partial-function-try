# Witch-Observation-Diary-Partial-function-try  
## "Serving as a teaching assistant for the game *Witch Observation Diary*, working out some methods to meet their project requirements"  
These two project folders in the folder **WODtry** are served for the realization of partial functions in **Witch Observation Diary**, which was one of the games developed during the third training held by Jiao Tong University, where I was responsible for the teaching assistant of this group.  
****
The one called **URPTest2019** is used to meet the **2D Bloom** requirement in the main menu with the help of **URP** and **Shadergraph**, and it's my first time to get in touch with these technologies, so it is not unexpected if there're some unreasonable codes or structures.  
The other called **VerySimpleFSM** is aimed to simulate fish swimming and eating behavious which is designed in Level 2. With the idea of **FSM**, I can easily switch the fish's status. And thanks to **[linxinfa](https://github.com/linxinfa/Unity-FishSwimByPath)**'s dedication, the logic of **swimming by path** can soon be realized.  
****
Unity version is ***2019.4.14f1c1***.  
***Universal RP*** is required for **URPTest2019**, and ***DOTween(HOTween v2)*** is required for **VerySimpleFSM**. Of course, ***2D Sprite*** is necessary as well.
